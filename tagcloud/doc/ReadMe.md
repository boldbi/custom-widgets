**TagCloud**

A tag cloud, is a visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) or to visualize free form text. Tags are usually single words and the importance of each tag is shown with font size. This format is often used to quickly visualize the frequency of words within a body of text, where more frequently used words are displayed with larger font sizes.
